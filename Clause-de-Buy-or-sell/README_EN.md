- Buy-sell clause

# Definition of the clause 

The buy-sell clause (also known as buyout or shotgun clause) allows a shareholder to make an offer to sell his shares at a fixed price to another shareholder but will require him, if his offer is declined, to acquire the shares of the other shareholder at the price he offered to sell his shares for. 
This clause is notably useful in entities with two equal partners (each holding 50% of the company). Shareholder A can make an offer to sell his shares to Shareholder B. If B declines to purchase the shares of A at the set price, A will have to buy the shares of B at the set price. 

# Use of the clause

A buy-sell clause is a provision included in a shareholders’ agreement or in a partnership agreement to avoid deadlock in the event of a disagreement between partners, which could be detrimental to the company. In a partnership with two equal shareholders, one (or both) of them may wish to end their partnership in the company. The buy-sell clause enables to solve this conflict as each party can trigger the mechanism which will result in the exit from the company of one of the partners.  

Here are the different stages of the process:

•	The notice of sale

The shareholder wishing to terminate his association with the company (the “offering shareholder”) must inform the other shareholder (the “remaining shareholder”) through a written notice called “the notice of sale” in which he offers to sell his shares to the other shareholder or to purchase, at the price and according to the terms set in the notice, all the shares held by the other shareholder. 

•	The option period

Upon receipt of the notice of sale, the remaining shareholder must, within a defined period set in the shareholders’ agreement and known as the “option period”, notify the offering shareholder of his choice: 

-	Either to purchase all the shares held by the offering shareholder at the price and under the terms set in the notice;

-	Or to sell all his shares to the offering shareholder at the price and under the terms set in the notice.

In the event that the remaining shareholder has not informed the Offering shareholder of his choice within the given timeframe, he is deemed to have agreed to sell all his shares to the offering shareholder at the price and under the terms set in the sale notice.

•	Buying and selling shares

 Thus, if the Remaining shareholder chooses not to purchase the shares held by the Offering shareholder, the Offering shareholder must purchase all the shares of the Remaining shareholder.


•	Closing date

Any share purchase or sale ends at “closing date”, ie 60 days after the last day of the option period. 

# Statutory provisions (French law)

The buy-sell clause is not regulated by any specific statutory provision. However, care must be taken to comply with a number of provisions that may be applicable to the clause, although they are not specific to this clause. Amongst those, we will highlight rules relating to offer and acceptance (Code Civil, Articles 1113 - 1122) and those on promises (Code Civil Article 1124). Regarding the determination of the sale price, Article 1591 of the Code Civil will be applicable, as well as Articles 1592 and 1843-4 when a third party is called upon to determine the price.  

# Legal Framework

The existence of Buy-sell clauses may have raised some questions in France, but their inherent validity is hardly ever discussed any more, even though they need to be handled with caution.

The purpose of this clause will always be the exit of the company of one of the shareholders. This exit may be forced even though the shareholder will have agreed to the inclusion of such a clause in the shareholders’ agreement. It is therefore important to distinguish the buy-sell clause from the clause of forced removal of a shareholder. The latter is actioned through a disciplinary action against a shareholder which is not the case of the former, which is aimed at ensuring the permanence of the company.  

If the Buy-sell clause is triggered, one of the shareholders will have to sell his shares. Therefore, the statutory provisions relevant to the determination of the sale price (Code Civil, article 1124 and article 1591) are applicable and so are the provisions relevant to the intervention of a third party in the determination the price, be it any ‘third party’ (Code Civil article 1592) or an ‘expert’ (Code Civil article 1843-4).

Since the Buy-sell clause operates following the principle of a unilateral promise of sale, there is a risk of revocation from the promisor. However, article 1124 of the Code Civil provides some protections for the promisee.   

The Buy-sell clause contains another risk: given that the partners in the company commit to sell or buy each other’s shares, such mechanism risks being reclassified as a reciprocal promise. However, two courts decisions (one from the 14th January 2014 and the other from 27th September 2017) have enabled to better take into account the will of the parties.

# Drafting examples

This buy-sell clause applies in the event of a dispute between shareholders which is significant enough to block the operation of the company or even jeopardise the continuation of the company’s activity (hereafter a “Serious and persistent disagreement”).

This disagreement must have been the subject of a notification by one shareholder to the other and not have been resolved within 15 days following said notice.

If an amicable settlement is not reached within 15 days following the written request by the issuer of the notice, each shareholder will have the opportunity to notify the other shareholder, by registered letter with proof of receipt, of his intention to sell his entire interest in the company. 

The issuer of the notice will indicate the price and the terms of the sale of his interest.

The remaining shareholder must choose, within 30 calendar days of the first presentation of the notice, between the two following options:

•	agree to buy all the shares owned by the offering shareholder, at the price and terms of the offer;

•	or, refuse to buy the shares of the offering shareholder but then have to sell him all his shares in the company at the price and under the conditions set in the initial offer.

In both cases, the decision must be communicated by registered letter with proof of receipt, or any other equivalent means.
