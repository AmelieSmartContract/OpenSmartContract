DEFINITION OF THE CLAUSE 

The buy-sell clause (also known as buyout or shotgun clause) allows a shareholder to make an offer to sell his shares at a fixed price to another shareholder but will require him, if his offer is declined, to acquire the shares of the other shareholder at the price he offered to sell his shares for. 
This clause is notably useful in entities with two equal partners (each holding 50% of the company). Shareholder A can make an offer to sell his shares to Shareholder B. If B declines to purchase the shares of A at the set price, A will have to buy the shares of B at the set price.
