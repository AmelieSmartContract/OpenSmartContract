- Buy-sell clause

# Definition of the clause 

The buy-sell clause (also known as buyout or shotgun clause) allows a shareholder to make an offer to sell his shares at a fixed price to another shareholder but will require him, if his offer is declined, to acquire the shares of the other shareholder at the price he offered to sell his shares for. 
This clause is notably useful in entities with two equal partners (each holding 50% of the company). Shareholder A can make an offer to sell his shares to Shareholder B. If B declines to purchase the shares of A at the set price, A will have to buy the shares of B at the set price. 

# Use of the clause

A buy-sell clause is a provision included in a shareholders’ agreement or in a partnership agreement to avoid deadlock in the event of a disagreement between partners, which could be detrimental to the company. In a partnership with two equal shareholders, one (or both) of them may wish to end their partnership in the company. The buy-sell clause enables to solve this conflict as each party can trigger the mechanism which will result in the exit from the company of one of the partners.  

Here are the different stages of the process:

•	The notice of sale
The shareholder wishing to terminate his association with the company (the “offering shareholder”) must inform the other shareholder (the “remaining shareholder”) through a written notice called “the notice of sale” in which he offers to sell his shares to the other shareholder or to purchase, at the price and according to the terms set in the notice, all the shares held by the other shareholder. 

•	The option period
Upon receipt of the notice of sale, the remaining shareholder must, within a defined period set in the shareholders’ agreement and known as the “option period”, notify the offering shareholder of his choice: 
-	Either to purchase all the shares held by the offering shareholder at the price and under the terms set in the notice;
-	Or to sell all his shares to the offering shareholder at the price and under the terms set in the notice.

In the event that the remaining shareholder has not informed the Offering shareholder of his choice within the given timeframe, he is deemed to have agreed to sell all his shares to the offering shareholder at the price and under the terms set in the sale notice.

•	Buying and selling shares

 Thus, if the Remaining shareholder chooses not to purchase the shares held by the Offering shareholder, the Offering shareholder must purchase all the shares of the Remaining shareholder.


•	Closing date
Any share purchase or sale ends at “closing date”, ie 60 days after the last day of the option period.
